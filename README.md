# Image Classification using Deep Learning

This project implements an image classification system using a convolutional neural network (CNN). The objective is to classify images into predefined categories using supervised learning techniques. The model learns visual patterns from labeled images and predicts the class of unseen inputs.

The project is implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras and runs in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

## Objectives

- Build a deep learning-based image classification model  
- Preprocess and normalize image data  
- Train and validate the model  
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy and loss metrics  
- Visualize predictions on test images  

## Key Features

- Image preprocessing (resizing, normalization)  
- CNN-based classification model  
- Training and validation pipeline  
- Visualization of accuracy and loss curves  
- Image prediction with class labels  
- Modular and reproducible notebook workflow  

## Dataset

- Dataset consists of labeled image categories  
- Images are stored in class-specific folders  
- Dataset is divided into:
  - Training set  
  - Validation set  
  - Test set  

Images are resized and normalized before being fed into the model.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- OpenCV  
- Jupyter Notebook
